# PacketTool
A home-made event management system designed to works with HxWebSockets (by IanHarrigan)
This version is dependency-free and library-agnostic so you can use it as an event manager for any other networking library.

## How to install
### PacketTool
Put the `PacketTool.hx` file inside of your `source` project directory. You can now use it like any other class of your project.

### PacketTool typedef support
Put the `PacketTool typedef support.hx` file inside of your `source` project directory. You can now use it like any other class of your project. Don't forget that the class name is still `PacketTool`.
WARNING : `PacketTool typedef support` is based on an old PacketTool version so it doesn't have all the current functionnalities. Also, this version is untested so it may doesn't work without some changes.

## Exemple
I am working on an exemple project using HxWebSockets and HaxeFlixel. There is no other exemple for now.
